      > They employ a external memory module (like cache) to storage the reperastion of data from previous tasks.Such a design is similar to knn, except that only the reperastion vectors are stored here.
   
      * [Meta Networks.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3305945) (ICML 2017, 272 citations)  
      > In few-shot learning, it's difficult to parameterize model rapidly through a few examples. They employ loss gradient as meta information and generate fast parameters for learner by a meta-learner. Base learner consists of slow parameters (optimized on specific-task) and fast parameters (generated by meta-leaner with meta-information across tasks).

      > "Prototype", a way imitating humans to understand the world. They build a meta-learner mapping instances to a low-dimensional space, and the prototypes of various categories are obtained by clustering. For target task in few-shot learning, the prototypes are built by meta-learner and answer the queries through neighbor-based method.

  > This paper has tried to mine the ability of multi-source during transfer. Sepecially, they propose maximal correlation weighting to generate an ensemble module to utilize the internal output from multiple pre-trained networks.
  > In my opinion, it seems like the custom stacking where the second model designed by maximize correlation.  
  > So, what kind of ensemble module is reasonable? robust? efficient? ...
