Virginia Smith, Chao-Kai Chiang, Maziar Sanjabi, Ameet S. Talwalkar:  
Federated Multi-Task Learning. NIPS 2017: 4424-4434  
http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7029-federated-multi-task-learning
> This paper fit federated learning problem as multi-task learning and provide different models for each client. 
> A optimization method MOCHA for multi-task learning has been proposed to handle the chanllenges in federated setting.
> For each client, the contribution to global update depends on its progress on local tasks. 
> As a result, the update from unstable and out-of-distribution could be limited.

> This paper builds a connection between graph regularization in multi-task learning and communication graph in federated learning.
> Local models and relation graph are obtained by iterative optimization.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12488
> This paper builds a connection between meta-learning (MAML) and federated learning, that meta-training in MAML corresponds to global update in federated learning. It adapts to the federated learning setting through fast adaptation ability by limited data.  
> Defect: Meta-learning "sounds like" a solution to federated learning. However, how to deal with system challenges is still a problem.
The contribution of this paper is limited.
