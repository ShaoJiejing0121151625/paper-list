> This paper has tried to mine the ability of multi-source during transfer. Sepecially, they propose maximal correlation weighting to generate an ensemble module to utilize the internal output from multiple pre-trained networks.
> In my opinion, it seems like the custom stacking where the second model designed by maximize correlation.  
> So, what kind of ensemble module is reasonable? robust? efficient? ...
